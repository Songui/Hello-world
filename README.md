# Hello-world
A new one for me !
My name is KONE Songui Hamed and the first one in my life is the LORD JESUS-CHRIST.
At this time, I'm studying econometrics and big data at the University of Orleans in France.
It is a big pleasure for me to be in that training, one of the best in his field.
Software SAS is the most important in our training, and also others statistics software like
R, Python etc.
We also have a lot of eminent professor in our field like Sir Hurlin, Sir Colletaz, Sir Ringuedé,
Mrs .... etc.
